      <p>This is a brief introduction to <a href="https://github.com/ympbyc/js-clos">JS-CLOS</a>. JS-CLOS is a JavaScript library that features multiple inheritance, multiple dispatching and multiple constructors. Multiplicating everything, you get multiple happinesses ;)</p>

      <h1>JS-CLOS</h1>
      <h2>What is CLOS in the first place?</h2>
      <p>Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) is a way to do OOP in Lisp. In CLOS, objects are basically just mutable hash-tables holding values. Methods are not included in these hash-tables. Instead, what's called methods in CLOS are implemented as <b>generic functions</b>. <b>Generic functions</b> are functions that work on multiple classes, a combination of them.</p>
      <p>Heres a sample code in Tklos, a variant of CLOS.</p>
      <pre><code>
;; a class representing instruments
(define-class &lt;instrument&gt; ())

;; flute inherits from &lt;instrument&gt;
(define-class &lt;flute&gt; (&lt;instrument&gt;))

;; musicians have a name and the instrument they play
(define-class &lt;musician&gt; ()
  ((instrument :init-keyword :instrument)
   (name       :init-keyword :name)))

;; flute players inherits from &lt;musician&gt; and they play the flute
(define-class &lt;flute-player&gt; (&lt;musician&gt;)
  ((instrument :init-value (make &lt;flute&gt;))))

;; generic function can-play?
(define-generic can-play?)

;; a flute-player can play the flute
(define-method can-play? ((f &lt;flute-player&gt;) (f &lt;flute&gt;))
  #t)
;; a flute-player can not play other instruments
(define-method can-play? ((f &lt;flute-player&gt;) (i &lt;instrument&gt;))
  #f)

;; a musician can play an instrument when the musician has the instrument
(define-method can-play? ((m &lt;musician&gt;) (i &lt;instrument&gt;))
  (is-a? (slot-ref m 'instrument) i))
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Implementing it in JS</h2>
      <p>I found a repository named JS-CLOS on github that someone in Russia has abandoned a year ago unfinished. I forked and made some commits to it. I ended up rewriting almost every line and believe I've come up with a usable solution. Here's what's equivalent to the code above in JS-CLOS. The code is written in CoffeeScript.</p>
      <pre><code>
## a class representing instruments
instrument = define_class()

## flute inherits from instrument
flute = define_class [instrument]

## musicians have a name and an instrument they play
musician = define_class [], (x) ->
  (slot_exists x, 'instrument', instrument) &amp;&amp; (slot_exists x, 'name', 'string')

## flute players inherits from musician and they play the flute
flute_player = define_class [musician], (x) ->
  x.instrument = make flute
  true

## generic function can_play
can_play = define_generic()

## a flute_player can play a flute
define_method can_play, [flute_player, flute], -> true

## a flute-player can not play other instruments
define_method can_play, [flute_player, instrument], -> false

## a musician can play an instrument when the musician has the instrument
define_method can_play, [musician, instrument], (m, i) ->
  is_a m.instrument, i
      </code></pre>

      <h2>Extension for Functional Programming</h2>
      <p>I extended JS-CLOS with some features to support some FP features.
         One is for dispatching methods on equality of values. This allows us to do something like this:</p>
      <pre><code>
fib = define_generic()

define_method fib, [0], -> 0
define_method fib, [1], -> 1
define_method fib, ['number'], (n) ->
  fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2)
      </code></pre>

      <p>Another such feature is the support for multiple constructors. With this, you can write ML style datatypes.</p>
      <pre><code>
color = define_class()
Red   = define_constructor color
Green = define_constructor color
Blue  = define_constructor color
WebColor = define_constructor color, (str) ->
  make(color, {webCol:str})

is_a Red(), color
#=>true
is_a (WebColor '#ff0033'), color
#=>true
      </code></pre>

      <p>More sophisticated examples will show up in my gist. Follow me if you are interested.</p>
